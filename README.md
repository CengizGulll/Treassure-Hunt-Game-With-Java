# Treassure-Hunt-Game-With-Java
The project involves creating a single-player treasure hunt game where the player explores connected rooms, represented as nodes in a linked list. Each room has doors leading to other rooms, based on data from a gamemap.txt file. The player begins in a random room and moves through doors, with each move tracked using a stack. Rooms may contain treasures or traps, determined randomly. Treasures are added to the player's treasure stack, while traps require the player to roll dice to overcome them. The game continues until the player collects all treasures or visits all rooms. The objective of this project is to comprehend data structure.
